# Vectorized Text Example


This repo contains a minimally working sample of how to process text data,
transform it into vectors (using TF-IDF), and then build a simple clusering
model (KMeans) on the vectors. It also included a [demo script](./cloud.py)
of making a [word cloud](./tswift.png) of top terms in the corpus.

The selected corpus was lyrics from Taylor Swift's songs performed on her
"Eras" Tour encompassing over 40 songs across 11 albums. Songs selected based
on [this](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/03/18/taylor-swift-set-list-eras-tour/11499422002/) article. Lyrics taken directly from Google search results.

You can see the resulting vector file [here](./vectors.csv).
